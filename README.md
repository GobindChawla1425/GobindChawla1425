Hi I'm Gobind Chawla and I am senior
Last year we coded on open processing and used an extension of javascript
I play tennis and basketball at ga and outside of school
One goal for this class for me is too get better overall with diffirent projects and learn diffirent languages
One worry I have is that I might struggle to learn a new language
